                The program color codes residues by type for easy sensemaking,
                and also allows you to manually edit alignments. SeaView's website provides
                executables for all major platforms.

                and  choose "Delete sequence(s)" from the "Edit" menu. You can use the feature to get rid of alternative splices,
                fragments, and otherwise suspicious sequences.

                small mistakes that the alignment program sometimes makes.

                for example. Though it would be better to go  and see if a more complete version of the sequence from the
                same or closely related species can be found elsewhere on the internet.

                we suggest you download a program called <a href="http://www.drive5.com/muscle/">MUSCLE</a>, put the execultable
                in the same folder where you placed SeaView,
                and then follow the steps  illustrated below:</td>
