                <li> *.png files: 1D score maps
                <li> *.pml - Pymol script, used to produce *.pse, pymol session file.
                    <a href="pymol_output.html">Read here</a> about how Cube presents results mapped on a structure,
                    or <a href="viewing_structure.html">here</a> about Pymol in general.
                <li> nameindex - table of shortened names used by the server, side by side

                <li> *patched.afa and specs_out.patchlog - when possible, Cube treats missing residues
                    as being identical to what is seen in a taxonomically close species;  *.patchlog
                    details which positions were treated in such way, and which species wer used as a template
                <li> *stdout and *stderr - output from the used code; useful for diagnostics, but can otherwise be ignored
