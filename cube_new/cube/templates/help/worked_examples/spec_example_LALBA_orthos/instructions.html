				Let's  look at lactalbumin and locate the regions of specialization since it diverged from lysozyme C,
				some 300 to 400 million years ago.

			<td align="left" colspan=3> The directory contains two files with extension *.fasta, and one PDB (structural file).
				Fasta files contain a
				collection of eutherian orthologues  for lysozyme-C and &alpha;-lactalbumin, obtained from
				<a href="http://cegg.unige.ch/orthodb6">OrthoDB</a> database.
				<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=2fyd">2fyd.pdb</a>
				contains the structure of &alpha;-lactalbumin in complex with 1,4-galactosyltransferase, the enzyme it regulates.

				You can upload both fasta files to Cube  at once, by pressing ctrl while making the selection. If you upload the pdb file,
				the <a href="../pymol_output.html#spec">pymol session</a> will be produced. You can use it to inspect the interface
				between the two proteins. Note that this interaction is specific for lactalbumin. Compare the levels of conservation
				across both lactalbumin and lysozyme families, with  the specialization within lacatalbumin group of orthologues.
				It is a cautionary tale about using conservation as a guide when the collection of sequences is a mixture of
				different paralogues - proteins similar in sequence, but with diverged function.
