		Assuming you have succesfully mastered mapping conservation onto 
		 <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32754">HPPD</a> sequence, lets take a look at
                mapping the information onto the structure. 
                Download the <a href="cons_example_input.zip">example directory</a>, if you haven not done so yet
		 (left click, or right click to save to preferred location, save and unzip). 
		 Find the file  with the alignment of sequences homologous to HPPD
                (refseq_search.afa) and upload. Using a pre-aligned set of sequences will make 
		things go a little faster. You can leave the Reference Sequence field empty.
		Upload the structure 1sqi.pdb provided in the directory, choose the chain A, and
		click submit.
