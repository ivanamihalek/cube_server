                peptide chains as dark teal-colored ribbons, small molecules as dark-teal sticks, and "structural" waters
                (the ones which carry chain label identical to the one selected in the analysis)  as light teal-colored
                speheres. Metal ions, if present, are indicated as magenta spheres.

            <td align="left" colspan=2> The difference now is that you can turn off the conservation visualization
                to reveal - in this order - several other things one can look for in contrasting the sequences:
                <ol>
                    <li> 'Discriminant' positions - positions that are well conserved within each group under consideration
                        but different across different groups (labeled as 'specificity' in the Pymol session).
                    <li> Conservation within the reference group (that would be the group to which your reference sequence belongs)
                    <li> 'Determinants' for your group - positions that are relativealy well conserved in the reference group,
                        and different then in the remaining groups (note that now we are not saying anything about the conservation
                        status in other groups. The position may be conserved or variable in the other groups, as long as the overlap
                        with the aminio acid types in the reference group is small).
                </ol>

                The other elements present in the PDB file are indicated
                similarly as in the conservation case above.
