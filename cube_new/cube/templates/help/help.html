                        Cube is a server for comparative analysis of protein sequences.
                        A group of sequences can be compared to find regions they have in common
                        ('<a href="../conservation.html">conservation analysis</a>').

                        Alternatively, if  it is known that the  sequences can be divided into several  groups or classes,
                        such as two
                        <a href="../db/html/homologues.html">paralogous</a> families of proteins,  or proteins from two different
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_%28biology%29">kingdoms</a>,
                        they can be contrasted to
                        find regions in which they differ,
                        conferring  the specific function to each group
                        ('<a href="../specialization.html">specialization analysis</a>').

                        The purpose of such an exercise is, typically, to help in the rational design of single-site
                        mutational experiments, to estimate the impact of SNPs, or guide computational docking.
                        Specialization analysis, in particular,  may help in the search of separation-of-function mutants.

                <P>
                    Optionally,  the sequences can be pre-aligned (the server accepts

                    formats). If your sequences are already aligned, please tick the "my sequences are aligned" checkbox, otherwise
                    the server will ignore your original alignment.

                <P>
                    The reference sequence can be specified. All scores will be shown mapped onto this sequence.
                    (The positions that do not exists in this sequence will be skipped.
                    This is to avoid one extraneosly long sequence in the
                    input making the output unreadable.) If no reference sequence is given, the first sequence in the uploaded file
                    will be used.

                <P>
                    In addition, the structure can be provided. Check <a href="getting_structure.html">here</a>
                    if you are not sure whether your protein has a known structure.


                <P>
                    The default scoring method can be changed.

                    The users are invited to provide any  information that they already may have about the protein residues
                    (such as transmembrane regions, post-translational modifications sites, catalytic residues and similar),
                    numbered according to any sequence in the alignment. This information is added to the downloadable table,
                    alongside the conservation score, residue type, and surface accessibility information. Note: this information is,
                    of course, uploaded to the computer that Cube runs on. If you believe you  have something sensitive, you can
                    add it to the  spreadsheet after you download it.

                    This is arguably a subtopic of the input section, but it is so important and potentially confusing,
                    that we believe it deserves a section of its own. In <a href=" fasta_example.txt">FASTA</a> format, in particular,
                    a sequence header might look something like this
                <pre>
           >gi|114647465|ref|XP_528667.2| PREDICTED: 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase isoform 3 [Pan troglodytes]. 
               </pre>
                <P>
                    Note the '>' character - it is not arbitrary, nor optional. In FASTA format it marks the beginning of the header line.
                    (You can read more about the FASTA format on its <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format'>Wikipedia page</a>).
                    In  this case, everything before the first space (e.g. 'gi|114647465|ref|XP_528667.2|')
                    will be taken as the input identifier for the sequence.
                    However, this identifier is a clunker, loaded with special characters, and completely un-informative regarding the
                    sequence it labels. Cube will therefore try to shorten the name to something like PAN_TRO_114647465.

                <P>
                    When adding the annotation, you can use 'gi|114647465|ref|XP_528667.2|' as the sequence name. Alternatively,
                    you can use any  unique  part of it - such as '114647465.'
                    The server will try to find the sequence you have in mind by pattern matching.
                    This  will fail if the selected name is not truly unique, and result in the input processing error.
                    Therefore, try and give unique names to your sequences. Also consider the possibilty that the seqeunces wiht
                    identical names actually
                    <i>are</i> two identical sequences - in that case you can get rid of one of them.
