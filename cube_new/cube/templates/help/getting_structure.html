                and type in the name of the protein in the search window. Download the structure(s) that you like.
                Multiple structures might represent different conformations of your protein, or show it bound to different ligands.
                You can upload them into Cube server later to have the conservation/specialization score mapped onto them.

                it is that your protein, or regions thereof, are disordered.
                In this case we'll have to stick to 1D analysis. Cube will produce an xls spreadsheet and a png map
                for that purpose.
