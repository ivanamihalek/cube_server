    <left_title>Nice. What does that have to do with my research?</left_title>


    <P>
        These are tools for planining your experiment.

    <P>
        Check out the regions on the surface in which the families differ. Cube indicates them in shades of orange.
        Typically they coincide with  a position of interaction specific for the subfamily of proteins.
        If the structure is not known, or if the protein is disordered, we have to work with the 1D information alone.
        A bit more difficult, but still doable.

    <p>

        Collect in the spreadsheet  information/annotation  from all sources that you have available
        - including your own previous work. To start you off, Cube will provide the info about conservation,
        specialization, and protein surface, where available.
        Put it all together in a slide,
        against the backdrop of the conservation map, and use for discussion with your geek friends.
        Do you know already that one of the families engages in a particular interaction the others do not? Specialization
        regions are good candidates for the separation-of-function mutational analysis.
